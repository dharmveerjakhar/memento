/**
 * Calculator for life calendar metrics.
 *
 * This class provides pure functions to calculate the number of weeks lived,
 * total weeks in a lifetime, and current position in the life calendar grid.
 * All calculations are based on the user's birth date and expected life span.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
 * ```kotlin
 * val calculator = LifeCalendarCalculator()
 * val birthDate = LocalDate.of(1990, 5, 15)
 * val weeksLived = calculator.calculateWeeksLived(birthDate)
 * val totalWeeks = calculator.calculateTotalWeeks(lifeExpectancy = 80)
 * ```
 *
 * @see CalendarMetrics for the complete result data class
